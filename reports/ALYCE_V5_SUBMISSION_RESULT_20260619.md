## Interpretation

V5 is now in the official queue, but no official score exists yet. Do not treat
this as an improvement over V2 unless `53851968` completes above the latest V2
rating snapshot.

Local V5 evidence before submission was mixed:

```text
1v1 V5 vs V2: 5-1 in the small local screen
1v1 V5 vs V1: 2-3-1 in the small local screen
4P V1/V2/V3/V5 family screen: V2 6/12 wins, V5 2/12 wins
determinism audit: repeated same seed/order was not stable
```

The package was submitted because the user explicitly requested a V5 upload, not
because the local 4P gate justified promotion.

## Next Check

Poll status without resubmitting:

```bash
kaggle competitions submissions -c orbit-wars
```

If the status becomes `COMPLETE`, update:

```text
reports/SCORECARD.md
reports/ALYCE_V5_SUBMISSION_RESULT_20260619.md
```

If the status becomes `ERROR`, inspect the Kaggle error and do not submit a fix
without a fresh package audit.
