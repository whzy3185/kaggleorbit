## Interpretation

V6 completed and is the current official best observed in this repository.

Local evidence before submission:

```text
py_compile: pass
smoke: pass
V6 vs V2 1v1 small screen: 5-3-2
V6 vs V1 1v1 small screen: 3-4-3
4P fixed-seat screen: promising
4P rotated-seat screen: unstable and not promotion-worthy
trace: production-gap mode changed one selected action in two traced games
```

The package was submitted because the user explicitly requested a V6 upload, not
because local 4P gates justified promotion.
